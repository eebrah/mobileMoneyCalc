mobileMoneyCalc
===============

open source, web based calculator for mobile money transactions in kenya

Single file PHP script, needs a web browser with PHP to function, tested on PHP 5.3.3. The resultant HTML file can be saved and used offline, requiring only a browser with Javascript enabled for it to function. 

Supports M-Pesa, Airtel Money, Orange Money and Yu-Cash. Hard coded values so edits will be needed every time rates change.

Can work without Javascript, but feels better with it.

Can work offline, but Javascript will have to be enabled for this to work.
